# django_snek
Fooling around with django tutorial, only instead of a **polls** app, I made a **fic** one. 

## Tutorial link

Currently working off of the [polls tutorial in the official Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/). About to start on [part 3](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial03/).

## To Do

- [ ] add modified django install files to repo
- [ ] make quick list of important stuff I've already done as part of the tutorial
- [ ] include admin user details
